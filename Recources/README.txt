My CFG is set up in a way that allows you to spectate every individual Player with a button.
F1 to F6 are Red Scout1, Scout2, Soldier1, Soldier2, Demoman, Medic.
F7 to F12 are Blu Scout1, Scout2, Soldier1, Soldier2, Demoman, Medic.
1 to 5 are Red Sniper, Heavy, Engie, Spy, Pyro.
6 to 0 are Blu Sniper, Heavy, Engie, Spy, Pyro.
UpArrow will activate the HUD and put the Game volume to 0.1
DownArrow will deactivate the HUD and mute the Game. (Used in pregame DM/In between scene)

These Key binds are just suggestions. You can change them up as you want, as long as it doesn't hinder the production quality.

The ConVars inside this CFG are Mandatory! if you are using a custom CFG, please make sure to copy over all ConVars.

The Startup options need to be set inside Steam.

The Fonts CodeProLC and CodeProBold need to be installed. Please make sure that the Fonts work inside your OBS. Contact me if not.

There are now 2 Logs.TF Sources inside the Logs Scene. You will have to copy the Logs link into 1 of them to refresh them both. The Source higher on the list shows the Medic stats.
Leaving it invisible (clicking the eye icon) will show the normal Logs screen. Making it Visible reveals the Medic stats on top of the normal Logs.
In OBS studio mode, you will have to Transition to the Logs Scene if you want the Medic stats to show up on stream.
You may need to resize the Sources if team sizes change. To resize, unlock the Source, hold ALT and drag the red dots into the direction you want to crop.

On the In between Scene, Staff Pictures are now supposed to be Round. This can be achieved through a filter I've implemented.
To install the filter, Right click EACH Staff Picture and go to "Filters". There you will find a "Image Mask/Blend" filter.
Click on it and, on the right hand side you should see the settings pop up. Now you have to redirect the Path of the Filter into your Overlays folder (..\Recources\Oberlays\Mask.png)

Scene transition Frame is now 26!

The new Scene presets are Mandatory to install. The Options presets are optional.

If you have trouble with any of these functions, PM me directly.
